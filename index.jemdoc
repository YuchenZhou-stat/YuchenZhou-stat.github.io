I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu Department of Statistics and Data Science] at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania, supervised by Professor [https://yuxinchen2020.github.io Yuxin Chen]. Previously, I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, co-advised by Professor [http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~anruzhang/ Anru Zhang] and Professor [http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~yzwang/ Yazhen Wang]. Before my Ph.D., I received my bachelor's degree from [http://www.math.pku.edu.cn School of Mathematical Sciences] at Peking University in 2016, advised by Professor [http://www.liweiwang-pku.com Liwei Wang]. \n
\n
I am interested in high-dimensional statistical inference, tensor data analysis, reinforcement learning and statistical learning theory. \n
\n
My Erd≈ës number is 3. \n
